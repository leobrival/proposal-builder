### 2.2 Typography System

#### Primary Typeface: Inter

Inter is our primary typeface, chosen for its excellent legibility at all sizes, extensive weight range, and modern character. It is designed specifically for screens and performs well in both UI and marketing contexts.

**Font Family**: Inter (Google Fonts / Variable Font)
**Fallback Stack**: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif`

**Available Weights**:

| Weight | Name | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| 400 | Regular | Body text, descriptions |
| 500 | Medium | UI labels, navigation, emphasis |
| 600 | Semi-bold | Subheadings, button text |
| 700 | Bold | Headlines, important callouts |

#### Type Scale

**Desktop**:

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Display (Hero) | 56px / 3.5rem | 700 | 1.1 | -1.5px |
| H1 | 48px / 3rem | 700 | 1.2 | -1px |

#### Typography Guidelines

**Do**:

- Use Inter consistently across all brand touchpoints
- Maintain hierarchy with appropriate weight and size variations
- Ensure adequate line height for readability (1.5-1.6 for body text)
- Use sentence case for most UI elements
- Use title case for major headings only

**Do Not**:

- Mix Inter with other sans-serif fonts
- Use font weights below 400 (too light for accessibility)
- Set body text smaller than 14px
- Use more than 3 different sizes in a single component
- Fully capitalize body text (except for short labels/badges)

### 2.3 Logo Concept Direction

**Note**: This section provides guidelines for logo development. Final logo files will be created by a designer following these specifications.

#### Logo Type

**Recommended**: Combination Mark (Icon + Wordmark)

A combination mark provides maximum flexibility: the icon can be used alone as an app icon or favicon, while the full logo with wordmark establishes brand recognition in marketing materials.

#### Logo Concept

**Visual Direction**:

The logo should communicate:

1. **Connection** - The bridge between creators/organizations and sponsors
2. **Simplicity** - Reflecting the product's ease of use
3. **Professionalism** - Suitable for business contexts
4. **Forward motion** - Suggesting progress and achievement

**Symbol Exploration Directions**:

| Direction | Concept | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Direction A** | Abstract handshake or connection | Represents the partnership between creators and sponsors |
| **Direction B** | Arrow or forward motion | Represents progress, getting proposals out the door |
| **Direction C** | Document with highlight | Represents the core product (proposals) made special |
| **Direction D** | Lightning bolt in frame | Represents speed and professionalism combined |

**Wordmark Style**:

- Font: Custom lettering based on Inter or similar geometric sans-serif
- Weight: Semi-bold to Bold
- Case: "Spons Easy" (Title Case) or "sponseasy" (lowercase)
- Consider subtle customization: ligatures, unique letter forms

#### Logo Specifications

**Primary Logo**:

- Full combination mark (icon + wordmark)
- Horizontal orientation
- Used when space allows and brand recognition is priority

**Secondary Logo**:

- Stacked version (icon above wordmark)
- For square/vertical placements

**Icon Only**:

- For favicons, app icons, social media avatars
- Must be recognizable at 16x16 pixels

**Clear Space**:

- Minimum clear space: Height of the icon on all sides
- No other elements should encroach on this space

**Minimum Size**:

| Format | Minimum Width |
|--------|---------------|
| Primary logo (print) | 30mm |
| Primary logo (digital) | 120px |
| Icon only (digital) | 16px |

#### Logo Color Applications

| Version | Primary Color | Background |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Full color | Ocean Blue (#3B82F6) | White or Light Gray |
| Reversed | White | Ocean Blue or Charcoal |
| Monochrome (dark) | Charcoal (#1F2937) | White |
| Monochrome (light) | White | Dark backgrounds |

### 2.4 Icon Style Guidelines

**Icon Style**: Outlined (Line icons)

Our icon style uses clean, outlined icons that feel modern and professional without being too playful or too corporate.

**Specifications**:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Style | Outlined / Line |
| Stroke Weight | 1.5px - 2px |
| Corner Radius | 2px (slightly rounded) |
| Grid Size | 24x24 base (scalable) |
| Color | Single color (Charcoal or brand colors) |

**Recommended Icon Libraries**:

1. **Lucide** (Primary) - Clean, consistent, MIT licensed
2. **Heroicons** (Alternative) - Good for UI elements
3. **Feather Icons** (Fallback) - Minimal and clean

**Icon Usage Guidelines**:

| Context | Size | Color |
|---------|------|-------|
| Navigation | 20px | Slate Gray / Charcoal |
| Buttons (with text) | 16px | Inherit from text |
| Feature highlights | 24px | Ocean Blue |
| Empty states | 48px+ | Slate Gray |
| Social media | 24px | Platform-appropriate |

**Do**:

- Maintain consistent stroke weight across icon sets
- Align icons to pixel grid
- Use icons to support text, not replace it
- Provide sufficient spacing around icons

**Do Not**:

- Mix outlined and filled icons in the same context
- Use icons smaller than 16px
- Apply multiple colors to a single icon
- Use decorative icons without purpose

## 3. Brand Voice

### 3.1 Voice Attributes

Spons Easy speaks with a consistent voice that is:

| Attribute | Definition | Example |

| **Supportive** | We are on the user's side, cheering them on | "You've got this. Your first proposal is 5 minutes away." |
| **Clear** | We prioritize clarity over cleverness; no jargon | "Export as PDF" not "Generate portable document format output" |
| **Empowering** | We make users feel capable, not dependent | "You're in control" not "Let us do it for you" |
| **Warm** | Professional but not cold; human but not overly casual | "Nice work! Your proposal looks great." not "Excellent. Output generated successfully." |

### 3.2 Tone Variations by Context

**Error Messages**:

- Tone: Calm, helpful, constructive
- Goal: Explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- Example: "That image is too large. Please use an image under 10MB." (not "Error: File size exceeded maximum limit")

### 3.3 Writing Principles

**Principle 1: Lead with the benefit**

Always start with what the user gains, not what the product does.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Our live builder uses real-time rendering" | "See your proposal come to life as you build it" |
| "PDF export functionality is available" | "Share your proposal anywhere with PDF export" |

**Principle 2: Use active voice**

Active voice is more direct, engaging, and easier to understand.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Your proposal has been published" | "We published your proposal" |
| "Leads will be captured automatically" | "You'll capture leads automatically" |

**Principle 3: Be specific over vague**

Specificity builds trust and sets clear expectations.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Create proposals quickly" | "Create proposals in 5 minutes" |
| "Improve your sponsorship process" | "Get 3x higher response rates from brands" |

**Principle 4: Write at a 7th-grade reading level**

Our users are smart, but they are also busy. Simple language respects their time.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Utilize our comprehensive suite of features" | "Use all our features" |
| "Optimize your sponsorship acquisition workflow" | "Get sponsors faster" |

**Principle 5: One idea per sentence**

Short sentences are easier to scan and understand.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "You can customize your proposal's colors, fonts, and layout to match your brand identity while also adding your logo and cover image to create a cohesive look." | "Customize colors, fonts, and layout to match your brand. Add your logo and cover image for a cohesive look." |

### 3.4 Vocabulary Guidelines

| Word | When to use |
|------|-------------|

| Creator | Content creators (our primary users) |
| Publish | Making a proposal publicly accessible |
| Share | Sending the link to others |
| Professional | Describing quality output |
| Simple | Describing ease of use |

**Words We Avoid**:

| Avoid | Use instead | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Deck | Proposal | "Deck" feels too corporate |
| Media kit | Proposal | More specific to our context |
| Synergy | Partnership/collaboration | Corporate jargon |
| Leverage | Use | Unnecessarily complex |
| Seamless | Smooth/easy | Overused buzzword |
| Cutting-edge | Modern | Cliched |

**Banned Phrases**:

- "As you can see..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Think outside the box"
- "Low-hanging fruit"
- "Move the needle"
- "Circle back"
- "Touch base"

### 3.5 Voice Do's and Don'ts

**Do**:

- Address the user directly ("you/your")
- Use contractions ("you're", "it's", "don't")
- Celebrate user achievements
- Acknowledge frustrations with empathy
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible
- Front-load important information
- Use numbers when they add credibility

**Don't**:

- Write in third person ("the user should...")
- Make promises we cannot keep
- Use ALL CAPS (except for occasional emphasis)

### 5.4 Elevator Pitches

**10-Second Pitch** (Twitter bio, Instagram):

> Create pro sponsorship proposals in 5 minutes. Live builder. One-click publish. Free to start.

**30-Second Pitch** (DMs, intro calls):

> I'm building Spons Easy, a tool that helps creators and organizers create professional sponsorship proposals super fast. Instead of spending hours in Canva or Word, you answer a few questions and watch your proposal come to life in real-time. Then publish it as a website with one click. We're in beta and it's free to try.

**60-Second Pitch** (Podcasts, LinkedIn):

> If you've ever tried to land a sponsorship, you know the struggle. You spend hours creating a proposal in Google Docs or Canva, it looks amateur, and brands ghost you.
>
> I built Spons Easy to solve this. It's a live proposal builder. You fill in a form on the left, and a professional sponsorship deck appears on the right in real-time. When you're happy, you publish it as a beautiful website with one click.
>
> Brands can view it and contact you directly through a built-in form. Beta users are getting responses within days instead of weeks. We're launching the beta for free. Would you like early access?

### 5.5 Feature-Benefit Mapping

| Feature | Benefit (What it means for users) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Live preview builder | See exactly what sponsors will see as you build, no surprises |
| 5-minute creation | Spend time on your content/event, not on admin |
| Professional templates | Look as polished as creators with dedicated teams |
| One-click publishing | Get your proposal in front of sponsors immediately |
| Built-in contact form | Never miss an interested sponsor |
| PDF export | Share anywhere, even offline |
| Custom branding | Your proposal matches your identity |
| Lead management | Keep track of every opportunity in one place |
| View analytics | Know which sponsors are interested |

### 5.6 Objection Handling Copy

**"I can just use Canva for free"**

> Canva makes beautiful documents. Spons Easy makes proposals that convert. Our guided builder includes sponsorship best practices, tier structures, and lead capture, all designed specifically for sponsorships. Plus, you can publish directly as a website and track who views your proposal.

**"I don't have enough followers for sponsors yet"**

> Brands work with creators of all sizes. Micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates than mega-influencers. The issue is not your audience size; it's how you present yourself. A professional proposal helps you punch above your weight.

**"I'll do it properly when I have more time"**

> Your first proposal takes 5 minutes. That's shorter than writing one email. Every day you wait is a potential sponsorship opportunity missed. Start now, refine later.

**"We have no budget for tools"**

> Spons Easy is free to start. You can create and publish your first proposal without paying anything. We built a generous free tier because we know association budgets are tight.

**"This is designed for businesses, not associations"**

> We built Spons Easy with associations in mind. Our templates include sections specifically for mission, community impact, and member reach, exactly what sponsors want to see from associations.

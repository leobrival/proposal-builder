### Email 2: Social Proof / Pain Point Education

**Send**: +2 days (Day 2)
**Subject Line A**: "The #1 mistake killing your sponsorship proposals"
**Subject Line B**: "Why brands ignore 90% of sponsorship requests"
**Preview Text**: "It's not your audience size. It's this..."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Want to know why most sponsorship requests get ignored?

It's not because your audience is too small.
It's not because you're asking for too much money.

It's because your proposal looks unprofessional.

I've talked to dozens of brand managers, and they all say the same thing:

"We get hundreds of requests. We can tell in 3 seconds if someone is serious."

Here's what separates proposals that get responses from those that don't:

1. **Clear tier structure** - Brands want options, not a single "take it or leave it" price
2. **Professional presentation** - A Google Doc screams amateur. A polished deck says partner.
3. **Easy next step** - If they have to hunt for your contact info, they'll move on

One creator I spoke with, Marie, was getting zero responses from her Instagram DMs to brands.

She switched to a structured proposal format and got 3 brand meetings in her first week.

Same audience. Same content. Different presentation.

That's exactly what we're building at Spons Easy - the tool that makes your proposals impossible to ignore.

You're still on the early access list. More updates coming soon.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. Tomorrow I'm sharing the exact framework top creators use to structure their sponsorship tiers. Watch your inbox.

### Email 2: First Proposal Tips

**Send**: +2 days (Day 2)
**Subject Line A**: "3 tips to make your proposal irresistible"
**Subject Line B**: "What top creators include in their proposals"
**Preview Text**: "Small changes that dramatically increase response rates."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

{{#if has_created_proposal}}
I saw you created your first proposal - nice work!
{{else}}
Haven't created your first proposal yet? No worries - here's what will make it stand out when you do.
{{/if}}

Here are 3 tips that dramatically increase sponsor response rates:

**Tip 1: Use specific numbers**

Instead of: "Large engaged audience"
Write: "47,000 followers with 8.2% average engagement rate"

Brands love specifics. It shows you understand your value.

**Tip 2: Create 3 tiers (minimum)**

Brands want options. Even if you think they'll go for the mid-tier, having a premium option makes the mid-tier look like a better deal.

Psychology 101: The "decoy effect" works.

**Tip 3: Make the benefits tangible**

Instead of: "Social media promotion"
Write: "2 Instagram Stories + 1 Feed Post reaching 47K followers within 7 days of campaign launch"

See the difference? One is vague. The other is a concrete deliverable.

{{#if has_created_proposal}}
Want to update your proposal with these tips?

[BUTTON: Edit My Proposal]

### Email 3: Publishing Guide

**Send**: +2 days (Day 4)
**Subject Line A**: "How to get your proposal in front of sponsors"
**Subject Line B**: "Your proposal is ready - now let's get it seen"
**Preview Text**: "From published to pitch: A simple outreach framework."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

{{#if has_published_proposal}}
Your proposal is published - now let's get it working for you.
{{else}}
Once your proposal is ready, here's how to get it in front of sponsors.
{{/if}}

**The Publishing Workflow**:

1. **Click "Publish"** in your proposal builder
2. **Copy your unique link** (looks like: sponseasy.com/p/your-project)
3. **Share it everywhere**:
   - In your email pitches
   - On your social media bio
   - In LinkedIn DMs to brand contacts

**A Simple Outreach Template**:

```
Subject: Partnership opportunity - [Your Project Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], a [content creator/event organizer/association] reaching [your audience size].

I've put together a sponsorship proposal for [Brand Name] - I think there's a great fit between what you're building and my audience.

Here it is: [Your Spons Easy Link]

Would love to chat if you're open to it.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

Short. Professional. Gets responses.

The link does the heavy lifting. Instead of a PDF attachment that might not open, they get a beautiful, interactive page.

{{#if has_published_proposal}}
[BUTTON: View My Published Proposal]
{{else}}
[BUTTON: Publish My Proposal]
{{/if}}

{{sender_name}}

P.S. Pro tip: After you send your pitch, you'll be able to see when sponsors view your proposal (coming soon in analytics). Follow up 48 hours after they've viewed it.
```

### Email 4: Lead Management

**Send**: +3 days (Day 7)
**Subject Line A**: "A sponsor just viewed your proposal - what now?"
**Subject Line B**: "Managing sponsor inquiries like a pro"
**Preview Text**: "Turn interest into signed deals."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

{{#if has_leads}}
You've got sponsors reaching out - that's huge! Here's how to manage them effectively.
{{else}}
When sponsors start reaching out (and they will), here's how to handle it like a pro.
{{/if}}

**The Lead Pipeline**:

Every sponsor inquiry in Spons Easy goes through stages:

1. **New** - They just submitted the contact form
2. **Contacted** - You've responded
3. **Pending** - Negotiation in progress
4. **Converted** - Deal signed!
5. **Rejected** - Not the right fit (and that's okay)

**Best Practices**:

**Respond within 24 hours**
Sponsors are talking to multiple creators. Speed wins deals.

**Use their tier interest**
When someone submits through your proposal, you see which tier caught their attention. Reference it:

"I saw you were interested in our Silver partnership..."

**Add notes for follow-up**
Use the notes field to track what you discussed. Future you will thank present you.

{{#if has_leads}}
[BUTTON: Manage My Leads]
{{else}}
[BUTTON: View My Dashboard]
{{/if}}

{{sender_name}}

P.S. No leads yet? Make sure your proposal link is in your social bios and email signature. Passive visibility = passive leads.
```

**CTA Button Text**: "Manage My Leads" or "View My Dashboard"
**Link Destination**: /dashboard/leads or /dashboard
**Success Metric**: Open rate >28%, Dashboard visits +15%

### Email 2: Tips for Better Proposals

**Send**: +3 days (Day 17 of inactivity)
**Subject Line A**: "The sponsorship proposal that got 12 responses"
**Subject Line B**: "What I learned from analyzing 100+ proposals"
**Preview Text**: "Patterns from proposals that actually convert."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I've been looking at the proposals created on Spons Easy, and I noticed some clear patterns.

**What high-performing proposals have in common**:

**1. A strong opening hook**
The first sentence of your project description matters. Start with your most impressive stat or unique angle.

Bad: "I'm a content creator looking for sponsors."
Good: "My tech reviews have generated 2.4M views and driven EUR 340K in affiliate sales for my partners."

**2. Exactly 3-4 sponsorship tiers**
Two tiers feels limited. Five feels overwhelming. Three or four is the sweet spot.

**3. At least one "anchor" tier**
Include a premium tier that's priced higher than you'd expect anyone to buy. It makes your other tiers look like a bargain.

**4. Specific, quantified benefits**
"Social media promotion" = vague
"2 Instagram posts + 3 Stories to 45K engaged followers" = specific

**5. Professional imagery**
A cover image and logo make a huge difference. Even a simple Canva graphic works.

---

Here's one proposal that got 12 sponsor inquiries in its first month:

- 3 tiers (EUR 500, EUR 1,500, EUR 3,500)
- Clear benefit breakdown for each tier
- Cover image showing event atmosphere
- Response time goal mentioned: "We respond within 24 hours"

Simple, professional, effective.

## Sequence 4: Upgrade Sequence (3 Emails)

**Objective**: Convert free users to Pro subscription
**Target Audience**: Free users hitting upgrade triggers
**Triggers**:
- Attempted to create 2nd proposal
- Reached 10 leads limit
- Attempted PDF export
- Attempted to remove branding
**Duration**: 5 days

---

### Email 1: Value of Pro Tier

**Send**: Immediately upon hitting upgrade trigger
**Subject Line A**: "You're ready for Pro - here's what you get"
**Subject Line B**: "Unlock unlimited proposals (special offer inside)"
**Preview Text**: "Everything you need to land more sponsorships."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

{{#if trigger == "second_proposal"}}
I noticed you tried to create a second proposal. You're getting serious about sponsorships - I love it.
{{/if}}
{{#if trigger == "lead_limit"}}
Congrats - you've received {{leads_count}} leads! Your proposals are working. Let's make sure you don't miss any more.
{{/if}}
{{#if trigger == "pdf_export"}}
You wanted to export your proposal to PDF. Smart move - some sponsors still prefer email attachments.
{{/if}}
{{#if trigger == "remove_branding"}}
You wanted to remove the Spons Easy branding. I get it - sometimes you want your proposals to look 100% custom.
{{/if}}

You've outgrown the free tier - and that's a good problem to have.

**Here's what Pro gives you**:

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---------|------|-----|
| Active proposals | 1 | Unlimited |
| Leads captured | 10/month | Unlimited |
| PDF export | No | Yes |
| Custom branding | No | Yes |
| Analytics | No | Yes |
| Priority support | No | Yes |

**The math**:

Pro costs EUR 29/month.

One sponsorship deal - even a small one - pays for years of Pro.

If your proposals are already getting traction (and they are), Pro removes the limits holding you back.

[BUTTON: Upgrade to Pro - EUR 29/month]

Not ready? No pressure. Your free account isn't going anywhere.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. Prefer annual? Get 2 months free when you pay yearly (EUR 290/year instead of EUR 348).

### Email 2: Social Proof + Objection Handling

**Send**: +2 days
**Subject Line A**: "How Marie landed 3 sponsors in her first month"
**Subject Line B**: "What Pro users say about the upgrade"
**Preview Text**: "Real results from real users."

**Body**:

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Still thinking about upgrading? Let me share some results from Pro users.

---

**Marie, YouTuber (47K subscribers)**

"I was skeptical about paying for another tool. But within 3 weeks of upgrading, I closed 3 brand deals worth EUR 4,500. The PDF export alone made my pitches 10x more professional."

**Thomas, Event Organizer (Tech Conference)**

"I used to spend 2 weeks creating sponsorship decks for each event. Now I create them in 20 minutes. Pro paid for itself with my first event."

**Claire, Association President (Tennis Club)**

"We went from getting 1-2 sponsor responses per year to 8 in our first quarter with Spons Easy. The analytics helped us see which tiers were most interesting to sponsors."

---

**Common concerns (and honest answers)**:

**"I can just use Canva for free"**
You can. But Canva doesn't give you a shareable web page, lead capture, or analytics. You'll spend hours making something that doesn't convert as well.

**"I'm not ready to pay monthly for a tool"**
Start with annual (EUR 290) and save 17%. That's EUR 24/month - less than one sponsored post should earn you.

**"What if I don't land any sponsorships?"**
If Pro doesn't help you land deals, you shouldn't pay for it. That's why we offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked.

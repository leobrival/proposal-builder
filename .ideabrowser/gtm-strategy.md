## Executive Summary

Spons Easy is a sponsorship proposal builder targeting content creators, event organizers, and associations in the French market. This GTM strategy focuses on a **zero-budget, community-driven launch** with three phases: pre-launch waitlist building (Days 1-14), closed beta (Days 15-21), and open beta (Day 21+).

**Key GTM Principles**:

- **Creator-first acquisition**: Leverage creator communities for organic growth
- **Product-led growth**: Let the 5-minute time-to-value speak for itself
- **Community as moat**: Build relationships, not just users
- **French market focus**: Dominate one market before expanding

## 1. Market Analysis

### 1.1 Market Size (French Market)

| Metric  | Value    | Calculation                                                          |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TAM** | EUR 500M | Total sponsorship deals in France (creators + events + associations) |
| **SAM** | EUR 50M  | Creators/orgs without agencies seeking EUR 1K-50K deals              |
| **SOM** | EUR 500K | Year 1 target: 500 paying users x EUR 1,000/year average             |

### 1.2 Target Segments

**Primary: Content Creator Clara (50% of users)**

- **Size**: 200,000+ French creators with 10K-100K followers
- **Pain Point**: Cannot create professional proposals, leaving money on the table
- **Budget**: EUR 10-50/month for tools (Canva, Notion, etc.)
- **Decision Maker**: Individual creator
- **Why Primary**: Fastest to acquire, vocal advocates, create social proof

**Secondary: Association Administrator Alice (30% of users)**

- **Size**: 1.5M+ associations in France
- **Pain Point**: No budget for agencies, proposals look unprofessional
- **Budget**: EUR 0-20/month (extremely price-sensitive, need free tier)
- **Decision Maker**: Board/President (consensus-driven)
- **Why Secondary**: High volume, strong word-of-mouth in federations

**Tertiary: Event Organizer Eric (20% of users)**

- **Size**: 50,000+ event organizers in France
- **Pain Point**: Recreates proposals from scratch, loses deals to faster competitors
- **Budget**: EUR 50-200/month
- **Decision Maker**: Event Director (may need approval)
- **Why Tertiary**: Higher LTV but longer sales cycle, better for post-PMF

### 1.3 Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors**:

| Competitor          | Strength                     | Weakness                                            | Price       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Canva**           | Brand recognition, templates | Generic (not sponsorship-specific), no live preview | EUR 0-12/mo |
| **Notion**          | Flexible, creator-loved      | Requires manual setup, no PDF export                | EUR 0-10/mo |
| **Pitch**           | Beautiful slides             | Overkill for proposals, steep learning curve        | EUR 0-22/mo |
| **Agency services** | High quality                 | EUR 500-5,000 per proposal, slow turnaround         | EUR 500+    |

**Indirect Competitors**:

- DIY: Google Docs, PowerPoint, Word (free but amateur results)
- Fiverr: EUR 50-200 per proposal (quality varies, slow)
- Not doing it: Many creators simply do not pitch sponsors

**Why Competitors Fail for Our Users**:

1. **Generic tools** (Canva, Notion): Not built for sponsorship workflow
2. **Expensive solutions**: Agency fees are 10-100x a monthly subscription
3. **Time-consuming**: Manual tools take hours, not minutes
4. **No live preview**: Users cannot see the result as they build

### 1.4 Our Differentiation

| Factor             | Spons Easy                   | Competitors               |

| **Time-to-value**  | 5 minutes                    | Hours to days             |
| **Purpose-built**  | Sponsorship-specific         | Generic templates         |
| **Live preview**   | Real-time split-screen       | Static or none            |
| **Web publishing** | One-click to shareable URL   | Export and email manually |
| **Lead capture**   | Built-in contact form        | None                      |
| **Pricing**        | Free tier + affordable plans | Free to expensive         |
| **Target market**  | French creators first        | Global/generic            |

> "Hey! I'm building Spons Easy - a tool that helps creators and organizers create professional sponsorship proposals super fast. Instead of spending hours in Canva or Word, you answer a few questions and watch your proposal come to life in real-time. Then publish it as a website with one click. We're in beta and it's free to try."

**60-second pitch (podcast intros, LinkedIn posts)**:

> "If you've ever tried to land a sponsorship, you know the struggle. You spend hours creating a proposal in Google Docs or Canva, it looks amateur, and brands ghost you. I built Spons Easy to solve this. It's a live proposal builder - you fill in a form on the left, and a professional sponsorship deck appears on the right in real-time. When you're happy, you publish it as a beautiful website with one click. Brands can view it and contact you directly through a built-in form. Beta users are getting responses within days instead of weeks. We're launching the beta for free - would you like early access?"

## 6. Growth Tactics

### 6.1 Viral Loop: Referral Program

**Mechanism**: Give 1 month free, get 1 month free

**How It Works**:

1. User publishes a proposal
2. Proposal footer shows "Made with Spons Easy" (removable on paid plans)
3. User gets unique referral link in dashboard
4. When referred user signs up and publishes, both get 1 month free
5. Track referrals with unique codes

**Viral Coefficient Target**: K = 0.3 (each user brings 0.3 new users on average)

**Implementation** (Post-MVP):

- Referral dashboard showing invites sent, signups, conversions
- Email notification when referral converts
- Leaderboard for top referrers (gamification)

### 6.2 Built-in Virality: "Made with Spons Easy"

**Mechanism**: Every published proposal includes a subtle footer

**Design**:

```
---
Created with Spons Easy - Create your own in 5 minutes
[Create Free Proposal] button
```

**Rules**:

- Free tier: Footer always visible
- Paid tier: Footer removable
- Footer links to landing page with UTM tracking

**Expected Impact**: 10-20% of proposal views click through

## 7. Objection Handling

### 7.1 Common Objections by Persona

**Content Creator Clara**:

| Objection                                        | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "I can just use Canva for free"                  | "Canva is great for graphics, but it's not built for sponsorship proposals. You'll spend hours getting it right, and it won't have live preview or built-in contact forms. With Spons Easy, you're done in 5 minutes with a purpose-built tool." |
| "I don't have enough followers for sponsors yet" | "Brands work with creators of all sizes - micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates. The issue isn't your audience size, it's how you present yourself. A professional proposal can land you deals even at 5K followers."             |
| "I'll do it properly when I have more time"      | "That's exactly why we built this - to save you time. Your first proposal takes 5 minutes. You can always refine it later, but getting something professional out there now means you won't miss opportunities."                                 |

**Association Administrator Alice**:

| Objection                                           | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We have no budget for tools"                       | "Spons Easy is free to start. You can create and publish proposals at no cost. We know association budgets are tight - that's why we made the free tier genuinely useful."                                 |
| "This is designed for businesses, not associations" | "We built Spons Easy specifically thinking about associations. Our templates include sections for your mission, community impact, and member reach - exactly what sponsors want to see from associations." |
| "I don't have time to learn a new system"           | "There's nothing to learn. You fill out a form, watch your proposal appear, and click publish. Most users are done in 5 minutes on their first try. No training needed."                                   |

**Event Organizer Eric**:

| Objection                                        | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We already have a process that works (sort of)" | "If it takes you 2-3 weeks to create proposals for each event, that's time and deals you're losing. Spons Easy lets you create event-specific proposals in minutes, so you can focus on what matters - producing great events." |
| "I need to get budget approval for new tools"    | "Start with our free tier - no approval needed. Once you see the time savings, the ROI case writes itself. We can provide ROI data to help with your business case."                                                            |
| "Will it integrate with our existing systems?"   | "For MVP, we focus on doing one thing brilliantly: creating proposals. You can export PDFs for your existing workflow. Integrations are on our roadmap based on user feedback."                                                 |

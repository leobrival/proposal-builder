| **Social Proof**    | Real-time waitlist counter creates urgency and validation             |
| **Zero Risk**       | "Free during beta. No credit card" eliminates financial anxiety       |

## Block 3: Problem Section

### Copy

**Headline (H2)**:

> Sound Familiar?

**Pain Points**:

> **You watch smaller creators land brand deals**
> They must know something you don't. Every time you see a creator with fewer followers announce a sponsorship, you wonder what you're doing wrong.

> **Your outreach gets ignored**
> You've DM'd brands on Instagram, sent emails, tried templates from YouTube. Nothing works. Your messages disappear into the void.

> **You don't know what to charge**
> When a brand finally responds, panic sets in. You lowball yourself, undervalue your work, or ask for so much they ghost you.

> **Your "media kit" is embarrassing**
> A messy Google Doc with screenshots of your stats. You know it looks amateur compared to bigger creators, but you don't know how to make it better.

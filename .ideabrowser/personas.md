**Social JTBD:**

### Forces of Progress

**Push (Away from current):**

- Income is unpredictable and stressful
- Embarrassed by unprofessional outreach attempts
- Seeing competitors land deals that should have been mine
- Platform algorithm changes make ad revenue unreliable

**Pull (Toward solution):**

- Professional proposals that impress brands
- Save 5+ hours per week on outreach admin
- Higher response rates from brands
- Data to know my true sponsorship value

**Anxiety (About switching):**

- "Will it make me look too corporate/salesy?"
- "Is it worth the cost if I'm just starting out?"
- "What if brands see other creators using the same tool?"
- "I might not have enough content/stats to fill the proposal"

**Habit (Keeps them stuck):**

- Already has Canva templates (even if mediocre)
- Manual process feels "more personal"
- Sunk cost in existing media kit attempts
- "I'll work on this when I have more followers"

4. **Makes Money** (Functional)

- **Key Messages**:
  - "Stop leaving money on the table"
  - "Look as professional as creators with 10x your followers"
  - "Your content deserves real partnerships"
- **Proof Points**: Creator testimonials, before/after proposal comparisons, response rate stats

### Quotes (Real or Composite)

> "I spend so much time on my content but I never know what to say when brands ask for my rates. I just panic and lowball myself."

> "Every time I see a creator smaller than me land a big brand deal, I wonder what I'm doing wrong. They must know something I don't."

### A Day in the Life

Clara wakes up at 9 AM and checks her Instagram analytics while drinking coffee. She has two comments from brands that might be interested but both are spam accounts - frustrating. She spends the morning editing yesterday's video, then films a new one after lunch. Around 4 PM, she sees a brand she loves just announced a new product launch. She wants to reach out but stares at her laptop for 20 minutes, not knowing what to write. She opens a Google Doc with her "media kit" - a messy document with screenshots of her stats. She thinks "I'll do it properly this weekend" and closes the laptop. The weekend comes and goes. The brand announces their influencer campaign partners. Clara is not on the list.

### A Day in the Life

Eric arrives at the office at 8:30 AM with three months until his tech conference. He has a list of 40 potential sponsors to contact but only completed proposals for 5 of them. His morning is consumed by a venue crisis - a scheduling conflict needs resolving. By lunch, he's only sent one sponsor email. After lunch, his marketing manager asks when the sponsorship deck will be ready so she can update the website. Eric opens the PowerPoint from last year's event - half the stats are outdated, the design looks dated, and the packages need restructuring. He spends 3 hours updating it, gets frustrated, and leaves at 7 PM having contacted zero new sponsors. "Tomorrow," he tells himself, knowing tomorrow will bring new fires to fight.

### A Day in the Life

Alice works as an accountant by day. Tuesday evening, she rushes from work to the sports club for training. Between coaching sessions, the treasurer reminds her that equipment replacement will cost EUR 5,000 they don't have. "We should find sponsors," he says for the third time this month. Alice nods, knowing she has no idea how to do this. At 9 PM, she's home and exhausted. She opens Google and types "how to get sponsors for sports club." She finds articles about "creating a compelling sponsorship deck" but they're all about big events or businesses. She finds a PowerPoint template but it's designed for conferences. Defeated, she closes her laptop. "Maybe we can do a bake sale instead," she thinks, even knowing it won't cover EUR 5,000. The equipment stays broken.

## Persona Validation Checklist

Before considering these personas validated, confirm:

- [ ] Interviewed 5+ people matching each persona profile
- [ ] Collected specific behavioral evidence (past actions, not intentions)
- [ ] Quantified time/money spent on the problem
- [ ] Identified actual solutions they've tried and why they failed
- [ ] Found at least 3 people per persona who would do a beta test
- [ ] Validated willingness to pay (or free tier usage for Alice)
- [ ] Confirmed the 5-minute time-to-value proposition resonates
